# AI-equity
Repository for sharing code used to build the AI-Equity map

The online map is available here: https://eppi.ioe.ac.uk/cms/Default.aspx?tabid=3923

This repository holds the Python code we used to screen and map the records. The original data file is in zipped format here too.

We then used another set of code to transform the final .tsv file into json in order to build the visualisation. (This is a bit messier and map-specific, so we haven't shared here, but get in touch if you'd like to use it.)
